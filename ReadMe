Hello My name is Daniel Jardine.
I really like finishing and completing challenges. I really like Programming because a lot of it is solving the problem or challenge like a puzzle.
I am more of a fan with backend programming then front end programming, but I do enjoy the end product when I finish a website and make it work. 
When I am not working or studying, I like to play videogames, go on runs, and hang out with my family.
